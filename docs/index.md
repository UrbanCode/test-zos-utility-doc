# Overview

The z/OS Utility plug-in includes steps for retrieving and deploying IBM z/OS artifacts.

This plug-in requires agents that run on the z/OS platform. The Submit Job and Wait For Job steps require the job server component that is included with IBM UrbanCode Deploy, Rational Team Concert, or Rational Developer for System z.

The plug-in includes steps that are related to deploying z/OS artifacts, such as the following steps:

* Copy Artifacts
* FTP Artifacts
* Deploy Data Sets
* Rollback Data Sets
* Cleanup Backup Files

The plug-in also includes steps that are related to running z/OS commands, submitting and tracking jobs, and working with data sets, such as the following steps:

* Submit Job
* Wait For Job
* Run TSO or ISPF Command
* Run MVS Command
* Allocate Data Set
* Copy Data Set
* Replace Tokens MVS

To learn how to import components from data sets in IBM z/OS, see [Deploying to the z/OS platform](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/urbancode-deploy/7.2.3?topic=integrating-deploying-components-zos-platform).

The plug-in also includes the Generate Artifact Information step, which scans version artifacts and generates text based on a template. The output text can be used as an input property for subsequent steps. Use the Generate Artifact Information to process data sets or members in a component version. You can also use the Generate Artifact Information step to select a set of artifacts to process, by applying filters on data set names, member names, deployment types, and custom properties.

The plug-in also includes steps that are related to managing redundant incremental versions, such as the following steps:

* Remove All Versions
* Remove Redundant Versions

## Compatibility

* IBM UrbanCode Deploy version 7.0.0 or later
* IBM UrbanCode Deploy agents on z/OS
* IBM z/OS version 2.2 or later with System REXX
* Starting with version 49 this plug-in requires Java 8 or above

## Installation

No special steps are required for installation. See [Installing plug-ins in UrbanCode products](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/wasdevops/blogs/laurel-dickson-bull1/2022/06/13/install-plugins). You must install and configure the z/OS deployment tools before you use the plug-in. To learn how to install and configure the z/OS deployment tools, see [Deploying to the z/OS platform](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/urbancode-deploy/7.2.3?topic=integrating-deploying-components-zos-platform). You must configure the job server component before you run the following steps: Submit Job and Wait For Job.
